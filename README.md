### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Looks like you have landed on the GitHub profile of [Brijesh Sahoo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brijesh-sahoo/). Now I am curious to know about your journey to this page.

I am a passionate software developer from India with almost 4 years of working experience, 3 of them as an analyst. Phew!. Feels like I am really old. Have been working at Tata AIG for almost a year now. I have somewhat of a non-conventional engineering background and keep trying to self-learn CS fundamentals via whatever medium possible to this day.

- ðŸ”­ Most of my time is spent building software backends for customers and other teams at Tata AIG. 

- ðŸŒ± These days I have started to learn more about UI frameworks like React. Still there are a lot of other things I would like to work with given the opportunity. Cool things on my bucket list include Flutter, Svelte, Go and Rust.

- ðŸ’¬ Not your typical first-mover in today's FOMO-world. Rather I try to build a strategy and then planning stuff out as much as possible. That said I am quite flexible: ask some of my colleagues here and they should vouch.

- âš¡ I am always eager to learn more about how to build and ship elegant and minimalistic products and features that take your breath away.

- ðŸ“« Besides coding, I enjoy listening to music (synth-wave, soundtracks and retro), podcasts (mostly career and software related, checkout [Changelog](https://changelog.com/) to get a taste), and watching sitcoms. 

Feel free to ping me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bforbrijesh) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bforbrijesh) to talk about anything you think we might have in common!.

**Languages and Tools I am familiar with:** _Javascript, TypeScript, Node.js, Python, Java, Serverless, DynamoDB, and a few others I can't recollect anymore_
